# AI_XDR_ML

This is a small example  Machine Learning with Python

With the AI revolution upon us, I wanted to research how in the Cybersecurity Space we can begin to also take advantage of the benefits of the new AI Models in the Cyber Space

What it comes down to is ... DATA !!!

Data and how we organize or how I like to say, "Sanitize It" 

The AI Machines are only as good as the DATA that they are trained on and how that data is presented to the machine.

This brought me down the rabbit hole of Feature Extraction and learning the best Factors and Features necessary to train the AI Model
   i.e Packets in a Network - Just like an IDS system, we can take the valuable data from the packet i.e. Src-Port/ Dst-Port/ Time/ Protocol and based on that begin to "LABEL" the ouput training the Machine on what packets are "Malicious" and "Benign" further of course extending this to malicious files and malware in general. 

   We can then also teach the machine to get the baseline of a network and even more efficiently than an IDS or XDR.


The AI Revolution is here to stay, and in the Cybersecurity industry we need Data Sets, more Open Source ones, so that more machines can be trained on more relevant Data rather than examples from years ago.

I realize that this kind of Data is proprietary for the big Cybersecurity Companies i.e. Mandiant, Rapid7, etc. We obviously don't want the bad guys also knowing what methods are working and which ones arent.

I do believe that with a better OSINT Community this could be certainly possible.

DATA is the most important commodity on this planet, and for good reason!
